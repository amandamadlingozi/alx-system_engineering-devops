##1.web stack debugging postmortem


##Issue Summary
Duration: The outage lasted from May 07, 2024, 10:02 UTC to May 07, 2024, 12:00 UTC.
Impact: During this period, the API gateway for the Web Stack Debugging Project intermittently failed, resulting in a 504 Gateway Timeout error. This affected roughly 90% of API requests, leading to major functionality issues across the platform where users experienced delays and errors in fetching data.
Root Cause: The root cause was traced to a misconfiguration in the load balancing rules within the API gateway, which led to improper request routing and excessive timeouts under normal traffic conditions.

##Timeline
10:15 UTC - Automated monitoring tools detected an unusually high rate of 504 errors from the API gateway.
10:20 UTC - The operations team began investigating potential causes, initially suspecting a server outage or spike in traffic.
10:35 UTC - Server health checks indicated normal operation; traffic levels were stable, shifting focus to configuration settings.
10:55 UTC - Misconfigurations in the load balancer rules identified as the likely cause; began cross-referencing with recent changes.
11:10 UTC - Confirmed that a recent update to the load balancing configuration was improperly applied, causing uneven load distribution.
11:30 UTC - Rolled back the recent changes to the load balancing configuration to restore previous settings.
11:45 UTC - API gateway began responding normally; continued monitoring initiated to ensure stability.
12:00 UTC - Full recovery confirmed; post-incident review scheduled.
Root Cause and Resolution
Root Cause: The outage was caused by a misconfiguration introduced during a routine update to the API gateway's load balancing rules. This misconfiguration caused some of the API requests to be routed inefficiently, leading to increased processing time and eventual timeouts.
Resolution: The issue was resolved by rolling back the load balancer configurations to their previous stable state. A comprehensive review of the change management process was conducted to prevent similar issues in the future.
Corrective and Preventative Measures.

##Improvements:

Improve the change management protocol for critical infrastructure configurations to include additional layers of validation.
Enhance monitoring capabilities to detect and alert on misconfigurations or anomalies in load balancing behavior.
Conduct regular training sessions on best practices and recent changes in technology for the operations team.
##Tasks:

Task 1: Implement a new configuration review and testing process for changes to critical infrastructure, to be completed by May 15, 2024.
Task 2: Develop and deploy enhanced monitoring scripts specifically tailored to detect early signs of misconfiguration or imbalance in load handling by May 25, 2024.
Task 3: Schedule quarterly workshops for the technical teams on the latest updates and best practices in API management and infrastructure by June 05, 2024.

##2.One day, we will write a song for us!!!

Cheers to writing more "posts-on-terms," because who doesn't love a good play on words while diving into the murky waters of debugging disasters? Let’s pour a glass to the understanding that even in the world of technology, terminology and terms of endearment can coexist—like calling our servers "sweetie" when they behave and something slightly less publishable when they don't.

##Who Dunnit and How We Fixed It: A Timeline

10:15 UTC - Monitoring tools, our digital watchdogs, started barking up the API tree with alerts about an unusual spike in 504 errors.
10:20 UTC - Our operations team, armed with copious amounts of caffeine, jumped into troubleshooting mode, initially suspecting a typical server hiccup or an unexpected traffic conga line.
10:55 UTC - After finding the servers humming along happily and the traffic at normal levels, the team scratched their heads and delved deeper into the labyrinth of configurations.
11:10 UTC - The plot thickened! A recent update in our load balancing configuration had unintentionally turned into a gateway-blocking monster.
11:10 UTC - We rolled back the changes faster than a cat video goes viral, returning to our previously stable configuration.
11:45 UTC - API responses started flowing as smoothly as a fine scotch. Stability was restored.
12:00 UTC - Full recovery was achieved, the digital equivalent of solving the Rubik's Cube blindfolded.

The Root Cause: A Misstep in Configuration
The Villain: A misconfigured setting in the API gateway's load balancing rules, akin to accidentally pouring salt instead of sugar into your morning coffee—a rude awakening!

##The Heroic Fix:
 
We heroically reverted to our old settings, avoiding a prolonged digital downtime. We then embarked on a journey to bulletproof our change management procedures, ensuring that future updates would not sabotage our smooth operations.
Corrective and Preventative Measures

To ensure our future is filled with fewer digital tantrums and more uptime celebrations, we've implemented several knightly measures:
Task 1: Enhance our change management rituals by incorporating additional peer reviews and automated tests, expected completion by May 14, 2024.
Task 2: Deploy a sophisticated anomaly detection system designed to sniff out configuration errors before they hit the live environment, ready by May 21, 2024.
Task 3: Initiate a quarterly refresher course for all tech team knights on the latest and greatest in API management and defensive programming, starting June 1, 2024.

##Visual Aid:

Because every hero's journey needs a map, here's a diagram showing where our API gateway took a wrong turn and how we guided it back to the path of righteousness:
(Imagine a simplistic flowchart depicting the API request path, with a red line indicating the misconfiguration and a green line showing the corrected path)
Epilogue
In our tale of API woes and victories, let's not forget the moral: even the best-laid plans of mice and men often go awry. But with a keen eye on our configurations and a hearty laugh at our own expense, we can tackle any challenge that comes our way.
Raise your glasses for the unsung heroes in IT who keep the digital world spinning, one config file at a time. Here's to fewer disasters and more dis-"asterisk" covered triumphs in our debugging diaries!
